I have had the pleasure of working with Chris on multiple occasions. I can say without hesitation that, the often-frustrating issues related to poor code, missed deadlines or unreliability, are simple eliminated when Chris is around. Chris takes the time to get projects done right and he has spent more than one weekend working on upgrades, maintenance projects and critical releases My association with Chris began approximately 2 years ago while I was serving as CEO of Black Box Code, a software solutions company. Chris and I worked together on many projects giving me authority to say, he is a meticulous planner and puts his whole heart into his tasks. This may seem trivial but having someone on staff that truly loves what they do is the difference between an average employee and a passionate professional, Chris is unquestionably the latter In my interactions with Chris he has always expressed the need to excel and progress. I recommend challenging him; this is where I was able to see the greatest growth in him. He quickly adapted and advanced to drive innovation and proper code practices. Chrisâ€™ exceptional personal and professional attitude also makes him a well-suited and fantastic team member. Someone suited to lead when needed and follow when directed Chris is, without a doubt, a quality software engineer and would do great things for your organization."
